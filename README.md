___

Our calendar was made in order for planning your events or using it as a diary.
By clicking on the exact day you can put any time and write down anything what is going to be on your mind then.
Try to find the day of your birth using search-area and see which cat is going to congratulate you on that date!

Our project does not include any frameworks or libraries - only Javascript, HTML and CSS for front-end part.
For back-end part we are now working on creating a database and server using Node.js technology.
That is needed actually for saving the client`s data, handling their authorization and performing all their other applications.

So click on the project preview to see how it works and stay tuned !!
