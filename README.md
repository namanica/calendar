# Cat-calendar planning page

Our calendar was made in order for planning your events or using it as a diary. These little cuties on the left are going to make your day even brighter - choose your favourite by pushing the arrows!

By clicking on the day you can put the exact time of your event (all you need is to type the numbers - don`t care about other symbols), mention yourself or anybody else as author and of course write down the event or what is going to be on your mind then.

Try to find the day of your birth using the search-area (all you need is to type the numbers - don`t care about other symbols). Put the month and year numbers, click on the search button or hit enter.

Don`t be scared to get lost in the year diapason - just click on the today button and come back to nowaday.

Our project does not include any frameworks or libraries - except built-in Node.js ones and installed additional packages for making our development process more comfortable (eg eslint, chalk, nodemon).
